In the majority of depictions, C-3PO's physical appearance is primarily a polished gold plating, although his appearance varies throughout the films; including the absence of metal coverings in The Phantom Menace, a dull copper plating in Attack of the Clones, a silver lower right leg introduced in A New Hope, and a red left arm in The Force Awakens.[1] C-3PO also appears frequently in the Star Wars Canon and Star Wars Legends continuities of novels, comic books, and video games, and was the protagonist in the ABC television show Droids."

One of the more popular Star Wars characters, Leia has been called a 1980s icon, a feminist hero and model for other adventure heroines. She has appeared in many derivative works and merchandising, and has been referenced or parodied in several TV shows and films. Her ""cinnamon buns"" hairstyle from Star Wars (1977) and metal bikini from Return of the Jedi have become cultural icons."

In the original theatrical releases of the original Star Wars trilogy, Jabba the Hutt first appeared in Return of the Jedi (1983), though he is mentioned in Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and a previously deleted scene involving Jabba the Hutt was added to the 1997 theatrical re-release and subsequent home media releases of Star Wars.

Jabba employs a retinue of career criminals, bounty hunters, smugglers, assassins and bodyguards to operate his criminal empire. He keeps a host of entertainers at his disposal at his palace: slaves, droids and alien creatures. Jabba has a grim sense of humor, an insatiable appetite, and affinities for gambling, slave girls, and torture.[1]
The character was incorporated into the Star Wars merchandising campaign that corresponded with the theatrical release of Return of the Jedi. Besides the films, Jabba the Hutt is featured in Star Wars Legends literature. Jabba the Hutt's image has since played an influential role in popular culture, particularly in the United States.

88,Captain Phasma,,,,,,,female,,,{},"Captain Phasma is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise, portrayed by Gwendoline Christie. Introduced in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), the first film in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, Phasma is the commander of the First Order's force of stormtroopers. Christie confirmed that the character would reappear in the next of the trilogy's films, Star Wars: The Last Jedi. The character also made an additional appearance in Before the Awakening, an anthology book set before the events of The Force Awakens.
J. J. Abrams created Phasma from an armor design originally developed for Kylo Ren and named her after the 1979 horror film Phantasm. The character was originally conceived as male before being changed to female. Phasma appeared prominently in promotion and marketing for The Force Awakens, but the character's ultimately minor role in the film was the subject of criticism. Nonetheless, merchandise featuring the character found success and her figure was the bestselling of all Force Awakens action figures on Amazon.co.uk.[3]"
